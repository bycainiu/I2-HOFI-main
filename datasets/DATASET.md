# Dataset Preparation Instructions

Follow these steps to download and organize the datasets required for training and testing the models in the `datasets` folder. You have the option to download directly from the official sources or use organized versions available through provided repository links.

## Available Datasets

## Dataset Structure
After downloading and extracting a dataset, please organize it as shown below to ensure compatibility with our code. For example, if you have two datasets, such as `Aircraft` and `Stanford Cars`, they should be arranged into their respective `train` and `test` subdirectories within the `datasets` folder:

```bash
datasets/
|_ Aircraft/
|  |_ train/
|  |  |_ train_label1/
|  |  |_ train_label2/
|  |  |_ ...
|  |_ test/
|     |_ test_label1/
|     |_ test_label2/
|     |_ ...
|
|_ Cars/
|  |_ train/
|  |  |_ train_label1/
|  |  |_ train_label2/
|  |  |_ ...
|  |_ test/
|     |_ test_label1/
|     |_ test_label2/
|     |_ ...
|
|_ ...
```
This structure should be applied to each dataset you use, replacing Aircraft and Stanford Cars with the actual names of the datasets you are working with. 

## Optimal Configuration for Each Dataset
For best results, models are trained with dataset-specific optimized settings. Configuration is applied automatically when running the usual training command:
```python
python hofi/train.py dataset DATASET_NAME
```
The script loads the corresponding configuration file (`configs/config_DATASET_NAME.yaml`) with pre-optimized settings for each dataset.

If you encounter difficulties while downloading datasets from our repository, or if you have suggestions for improving the download process, please feel free to create an issue in this repository.
